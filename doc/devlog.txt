The reading focused on the dangers of having an ego while programming and how to work with others in order to work quicker and more efficiently. Many programmers are detached from real people when they work, but the key to success is working as a team to debug and fix problems!

To be more awesome we will:
  1. Share our code with each other and check for bugs as we go to save time later.
  2. Seek outside help to check the code we write because we might overlook things because of our familiarity with the code.
  3. Not treat this project like itâ€™s the sum of our worth! This is not our code, it is the code we wrote together.
